LFCS EC2 Lab built with Terraform â€“ A hands-on project documenting my preparation for the Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator. This repo contains IaC to provision a free-tier AWS EC2 instance using Terraform, along with notes, configurations, and Linux practice tasks completed during my certification journey.
